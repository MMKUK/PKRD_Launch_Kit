# zk-RingCT Privacy Module for PKRD Blockchain

## Overview
This module integrates advanced zk-SNARKs with RingCT-inspired mechanisms to provide next-generation privacy for transactions.

### Features:
- Zero-knowledge proof integration with zk-SNARKs
- Ring signature-style obfuscation to hide input-output linkage
- Fully confidential transaction amounts
- No leakage of sender, receiver, or amount

## Usage
1. Run `install_zk.sh` to set up dependencies.
2. Use `zk_ringct_core.py` within your node logic to validate and process private transactions.
3. Ensure all node validators have the same module for transaction consensus.
