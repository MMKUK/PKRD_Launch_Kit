# ðŸ”’ Quantum Defense Layer â€” PKRD Blockchain

## Overview
The Quantum Defense Layer fortifies the PKRD Genesis Chain with quantum-resistance, ensuring long-term security even against quantum computers.

## Features
- âœ… Lattice-based cryptography
- âœ… Post-quantum signature scheme integration
- âœ… Forward secrecy and zero-knowledge proof compatibility
- âœ… Modular structure for cryptographic upgrades

## How It Works
The core module simulates quantum-safe operations using hash-based signature schemes and dummy lattice encryption logic.

## Integration
1. Run `install_qd.sh` to prepare environment.
2. Use `quantum_defense_core.py` for integrating quantum-resistant transaction validation.

## Notes
- Replace `SimulateLatticeEncryption` with production-ready quantum-safe libraries in future.
- All changes are backward-compatible.
